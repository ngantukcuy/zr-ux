# Dual-Axis Recognition Edge Case  
*(Event Axis vs Cognition Axis Misalignment)*

## Purpose
This document classifies an edge case where **event-based assessment** and **cognition-based assessment** diverge, producing conflicting interpretations of responsibility, anticipation, or fault.

The core issue is not the event itself, but **which axis is implicitly used as the evaluation baseline**.

This is a **reference / edge-case document**.  
It does not prescribe actions, decisions, or preventive measures.

## Core Axes

### 1. Event Axis
- Based on **objective occurrence**
- Framed as *before / after an event*
- Typically adopted by:
  - Organizations
  - Management
  - Post-incident review processes

**Key Question:**  
> Did this happen before or after the event?

---

### 2. Cognition Axis
- Based on **moment of recognition**
- Framed as *before / after awareness*
- Typically adopted by:
  - Individual workers
  - Operators
  - On-call engineers
  - QA / escalation roles

**Key Question:**  
> Was this known or recognized at that time?

---

## Structural Observation

The two axes are **orthogonal**.

- Event timing does not imply cognition timing
- Cognition timing does not retroactively alter event order

A single situation may therefore be:
- *Pre-event* on the **Event Axis**
- *Post-recognition* on the **Cognition Axis**

This mismatch is structurally normal, but **organizational language often collapses the distinction**.

---

## Edge Case Definition

An **edge case occurs** when:

- An organization frames a situation as **“pre-incident awareness”**
- An individual experiences it as **“post-recognition”**
- Responsibility is assessed without explicitly stating which axis is being used

This creates a **responsibility ambiguity zone**.

---

## Typical Manifestation

### Organizational Framing
> “This was a risk that could have been identified in advance.”

- Uses Event Axis
- Assumes availability of recognition
- Often implicit, not stated

---

### Individual Framing
> “I recognized this only after the structure was already formed.”

- Uses Cognition Axis
- Based on actual information access
- Often defensively interpreted

---

## Structural Risk

### Responsibility Shift Without Axis Declaration
When axes are mixed without declaration:

- Responsibility may be **retroactively imposed**
- Recognition limitations are ignored
- Individuals are judged against **non-existent prior cognition**

This results in:
- False negligence attribution
- Moral pressure disguised as hindsight
- Escalation failure amplification

---

## Classification (ZR Perspective)

- This is **not** a prediction failure
- This is **not** an execution failure
- This is **not** a competence issue

It is a **coordinate mismatch** between:
- Event-based evaluation
- Cognition-based responsibility

---

## Relation to Other Edge Cases

This pattern often co-occurs with:
- Silent Authority Events (implicit judgment standards)
- Hindsight Bias Framing
- Responsibility Boundary Collapse

It is structurally adjacent to the AI Subjectification edge case, where authority is transferred without explicit consent or declaration.

---

## ZR Handling Scope

### What ZR Does
- Identifies which axis is being used
- Makes axis selection explicit
- Prevents implicit responsibility transfer
- Stops judgment escalation at the boundary

### What ZR Does Not Do
- Decide fault or innocence
- Reassign responsibility
- Offer corrective guidance
- Normalize one axis over the other

---

## Minimal Structural Marker

> **Event sequence and cognition sequence are independent.  
> Responsibility cannot be assigned without declaring the axis used.**

---

## Example Classification

**Case:**  
“Why wasn’t this identified earlier?”

- Event Axis: *Before incident*
- Cognition Axis: *After recognition*
- Status: **Edge Case (Axis Misalignment)**
