# Governance

ZR is designed to be forkable.
This repository is a reference implementation, not an authority.

- Forks are encouraged.
- Divergence is allowed.
- The name “Zero Reflect (ZR)” must not be used to imply authority, endorsement,
  or normative correctness over forks or derivative works.

- The decision to adopt, reference, integrate, or rely on ZR (or any derivative)
  is made solely by the adopting user or organization.
- This repository does not participate in, approve, or influence such adoption decisions.

- All responsibility for adoption, interpretation, integration, and resulting outcomes
  rests entirely with the adopting party, including downstream maintainers and operators.

Licensing terms may define scopes of use or implementation,
but do not alter the principles stated in this governance.
