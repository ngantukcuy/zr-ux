# Zero Reflect UX

Zero Reflect (ZR) is a responsibility-boundary reflection library.

It does not decide.  
It reflects constraints.  
Responsibility always remains with the user.

> **Zero Reflect is the name that speaks.  
> ZR is the symbol that thinks.**

> ZR-UX exists to make boundaries recognizable, without giving conclusions.

This library may distribute AI capabilities,
but it does not distribute the illusion of AI judgment.

## Start Here

ZR is not a tool that gives answers.  
It is a tool that clarifies **where answers stop being delegable**.

Use ZR when:
- you are unsure who owns a decision
- a system feels helpful but vaguely authoritative
- you want to see constraints without being guided to outcomes

Do **not** use ZR to:
- get recommendations
- optimize choices
- offload responsibility
- confirm what you already want to do

ZR may output silence.  
Silence is a boundary signal, not a failure.

## What ZR Does (Minimal)

ZR helps you reflect:
- what is owned by you
- what cannot be delegated
- what is structurally unknown
- where automation must stop

ZR will never:
- choose for you
- rank options
- optimize outcomes
- imply authority

## How to Interact with ZR

When using ZR:
- ask about boundaries, not solutions
- describe constraints, not goals
- stop when responsibility becomes explicit

If ZR responds with silence:
- do not retry with stronger prompts
- do not reframe the question to force output
- treat silence as the final boundary
