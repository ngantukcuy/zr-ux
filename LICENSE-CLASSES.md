# ZR License Classes (Draft)

This document defines **license classes for Zero Reflect (ZR)** beyond the scope of the code license.

These license classes describe **rights of use and implementation**, not ownership or transfer of the ZR methodology.

All license classes defined here are **subordinate to and must be interpreted in conjunction with**:

* GOVERNANCE.md
* NOTICE.md
* The applicable open-source license (AGPL v3)

---

## 0. Core Principle

ZR licenses grant **scoped permissions**.
They do **not** grant authority, endorsement, ownership, or transfer of methodology.

ZR remains:

* Forkable
* Non-authoritative
* Non-normative

Responsibility for adoption, interpretation, integration, and outcomes **always rests with the adopting party**.

---

## 1. Use License

### Scope

Grants the right to **use outcomes produced by a ZR-based system** within a defined scope.

### Grants

* Use of ZR-derived outputs
* Internal operational use within the agreed scope

### Does NOT Grant

* Access to internal knowledge–instruction compositions
* Access to instruction wording or activation logic
* Transfer of methodology
* Authority or endorsement

### Typical Use

* Product usage
* Internal decision-support tooling
* Operational reference

---

## 2. Implementation License

### Scope

Grants the right to **implement ZR concepts internally**, using structural guidance.

### Grants

* Structural diagrams and role definitions
* Interface-level guidance
* Responsibility boundary definitions

### Does NOT Grant

* Actual instruction text
* Knowledge–instruction mapping
* Activation rules or composition logic
* Ownership of the methodology

### Typical Use

* Internal system implementation
* Adaptation to organization-specific workflows

---

## 3. Exclusive Use License

### Scope

Grants **exclusive rights to use ZR-based outcomes** within a defined scope.

Exclusivity may be defined by:

* Product
* Market
* Organization
* Time period

### Grants

* Exclusive use of outcomes within scope
* All rights of the Use License

### Does NOT Grant

* Rights beyond the defined scope
* Restrictions on the designer’s independent work
* Transfer of methodology

### Notes

Exclusivity applies to **usage results**, not to the underlying design principles.

Exclusivity applies strictly to the defined scope of usage outcomes.

It does not:
- grant authority over ZR,
- restrict the designer’s independent work,
- or imply transfer of design principles or reasoning structures.

---

## 4. Exclusive Implementation License

Exclusive implementation rights do not constitute assignment,
sale, or transfer of the ZR methodology.

The designer retains the right to:
- evolve the methodology,
- apply similar structures to other domains,
- and produce independent derivative systems.

### Scope

Grants **exclusive rights to implement ZR concepts** within a defined scope.

This is the strongest non-assignment license.

### Grants

* Exclusive implementation rights within scope
* Extended structural documentation
* Verification and audit criteria

### Does NOT Grant

* Ownership of ZR
* Transfer of instruction compositions
* Restriction on application of similar methodologies to other domains

### Notes

Exclusivity does not imply methodology transfer or designer limitation outside the defined scope.

---

## 5. What Is Never Licensed

Regardless of license class, the following are **never transferred**:

* Knowledge–instruction compositions
* Instruction wording
* Activation and reflection logic
* Responsibility decision internals
* Evolution rights of the methodology

These remain the core intellectual property of the designer.

---

## 6. Relationship to Open Source Code

The open-source code license governs **code usage and distribution**.

These license classes govern **system-level use, implementation rights, and exclusivity**.

They operate in parallel and do not override each other.

---

## 7. Final Note

ZR licenses define **where and how ZR may be used**,
not **how the designer thinks or constructs systems**.

Exclusivity is bounded.
Responsibility is explicit.
Authority is never implied.
